The Arduino esp32 has an EEPROM which requires careful
handling on begin(), but we need care too much now to get
the right EEPROM incantation, we just need the EEPROM to
store our calibration data for dry values.

So just disable the board for now, we might reconsider if
we can use some predefined compiler #define to handle this.

Disable esp32 support to workaround the GCC w/ designated array initalizers ICE

The esp32 Arduino g++ compiler seems to have and internal compiler error
when trying to use designated initalizers with enums as the indices.

This can be seen in travis.ci in the Arduino tests for commits on
branch gcc-ice-w-designated-inits

https://github.com/uCautomation/plant-watering-system/commits/gcc-ice-w-designated-inits

The typical errors look like below, but they seem to appear only on esp
Arduino tests. Since we don't care that much for esp32, just workaround
by disabling esp32 tests, instead of the ICE (log snippet with ICE follows):
